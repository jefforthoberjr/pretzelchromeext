Why does replacing the textContent accidentally blowup the css/styling/layout of the page?

	Comparing the DOM before extension and after extension:
		there are these "::before" elements decorated throughout the DOM normally that seem to get removed with extension.

		It appears the ::before elements are injected into the DOM after/during page load.
		So maybe the extension is touching the DOM too fast?
			Try adding a sleep statement to the DOM.
			Nope; it still blows away the styling after a 7 second delay.
